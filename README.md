#### About Snake
The game **Snake** may already be familiar to you, as it is one of the classics! The original Snake game is a video game concept where the player manoeuvres a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth manoeuvres. The goal is to grow the snake to become as long as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

The version of the game we will build in our project is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Our server code for this game was not written from scratch. It is a heavily modified version of the single player game [Snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).

### **Instructions**
